Before you start, check out instructions in settings.help. Note in particular that you need a valid API key which
you need to add to the plugin's settings menu.

The forward geocoding action comes with a free text search form. The algorithm responds with the top result of
Geoapify's forward geocoding API. The result is added as a point on the active map tile and as a point feature in
a vector layer.

See the API docs at https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/geocoding/forward-geocoding/#about to learn more about the
forward geocoding API.
